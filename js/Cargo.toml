# The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by
# logging them with `console.error`. This is great for development, but requires
# all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking` infrastructure, so isn't great for
# code size when deploying.

# `wee_alloc` is a tiny allocator for wasm that is only ~1K in code size

# allocator, however.

# Unfortunately, `wee_alloc` requires nightly Rust when targeting wasm for now.
